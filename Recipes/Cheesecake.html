      <h2>Ingredients Required</h2>
      <h4><strong>Cheesecake Crust</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>225g of graham crackers (about 14 crackers)</li>
        <li>85g unsalted butter, melted</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Cheesecake Fiiling</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unflavoured gelatin</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold water</li>
        <li>450g cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 1/2 (175g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>2 cups cold heavy cream</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Stawberry sauce (optional)</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>450g fresh or frozen sliced strawberries</li>
        <li>2/3 cups (135g) granulated white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, optional</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>Make the crust</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Lightly coat a 9-inch round springform pan with cooking spray. Break
          the graham crackers into a few large pieces and place them in a food
          processor. Process into crumbs. Drizzle in the melted butter and
          process until the crumbs start to clump together. Dump the buttery
          crumbs into the prepared pan and press into a thick crust over the
          bottom of the pan using the bottom of a glass.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>Dissolve the gelatin</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a microwave-safe bowl or
          glass measuring cup. Stir to moisten - it should look like applesauce.
          Set aside for 5 minutes to soften. Once softened, microwave the
          gelatin for 20 to 30 seconds, until the gelatin is dissolved and
          liquid. Set aside to cool.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>Prepare cheesecake base</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Place the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer and sift the
          powdered sugar over top. Mix on low speed with the paddle attachment
          until the sugar is begins to mix into the cream cheese, and then raise
          the mixer speed to medium and mix until the sugar is fully
          incorporated and the cream cheese looks fluffy and creamy, like
          frosting. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the vanilla
          extract. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds
          with the edge of a butter knife. Add the seeds to the cheesecake
          batter, and reserve the vanilla pod for another use. Mix for an
          additional 15 seconds or until the vanilla extract and seeds have been
          blended in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>Switch to Whisk attachment and add cream</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Mix on low speed until the cream is incorporated, then raise the speed
          to medium. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the
          bowl. Continue to mix, slowly increasing the speed to high, until soft
          peaks form (peaks that slowly bend over at the tips).
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <strong
              >Reduce the speed to medium and slowly drizzle warm gelatin into
              the bowl</strong
            >
          </h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          If your gelatin has cooled too much and started to gel, warm it in the
          microwave for another 5 to 10 seconds until liquidy again before
          adding mixing it into the filling. Once all the gelatin has been
          added, return the mixer speed to high and beat until the mixture forms
          firm peaks (peaks that stay firmly upright at the tips).
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <strong
              >Spoon the filling into the pan on top of the graham
              crackercrust</strong
            >
          </h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Smooth the top of the cheesecake. Cover with plastic wrap and
          refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight to firm up.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>Prepare strawberry sauce (optional)</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Place the strawberries and sugar in a large pot. In a small bowl, stir
          the cornstarch and cold water together until they make a smooth, milky
          liquid, and then pour over the strawberries. Cook on medium high heat,
          stirring constantly for about 5 to 7 minutes or until the strawberries
          have softened and the sauce has thickened. Remove from heat and stir
          in the balsamic vinegar if using. Let cool to room temperature, then
          spoon over the chilled cheesecake and return to the refrigerator to
          chill for an additional hour or overnight. (Alternatively, serve the
          sauce at the table and spoon over individual slices.)
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4><strong>When ready serve and enjoy</strong></h4>
        </li>
        <p>
          Run an offset spatula or a thin butterknife around the edge of the
          cake, then remove the outer ring. Leave it on the pan base, and
          transfer to a serving platter or cake stand. Top with any toppings you
          like. Slice and serve.
